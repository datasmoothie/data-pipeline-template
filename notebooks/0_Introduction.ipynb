    "Each Tally user has a licence key that allows them to access the API features. Typically, other individuals within your organisation who use your code, will need to acquire their own API key in order to make your project run (depending on how your project is setup) in their environment. They would then add their API Key to their fork of your project as a secret (encrypted environment variable).\n",
