# Tally data pipeline

Welcome to your Tally data pipeline. For more information about any of the steps involved in building a survey data pipeline, refer to the [Tally python documentaiton](https://python.datasmoothie.com).

To get started:
1. Connect to a database or upload your data into the data folder. 
1. Open the files in the notebooks folder and configure them to match your needs.
1. Give your project a name in the 0_Introduction.ipynb file
1. Run the pipeline
1. Explore your results in the outputs folder

## Folder structure

The folders in this repository are the following:

- **notebooks** - where your code is stored and the pipeline runs
- **data** - folder to upload SAV files and other data - this will not be checked into the repository for data protection purposes
- **specs** - any files that specify pipeline behaviour or preferences
- **outputs** - files generated by the pipeline


## Data protection

The contents of the data and output folders will not be checked into your repository or uploaded to your repository host (GitHub, GitLab etc.).

If you do want your files uploaded, remove the `.gitignore` file from the folder you want included in your online repository.
